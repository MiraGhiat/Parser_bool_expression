This is a sample program built in Java that parses and evaluate Boolean logic expressions that includes negation and parenthesis.

Boolean Expressions must have the following structure:

• And operator must me '^'
• Or operator must be 'v'
• False is !
• The conbination of all those above
• 'True' is symbolized as '1' and 'false' by '0'
• The expression must be fully parentheses and spaces as follow:

( ! ( 1 v 0 ) )
( ( 1 v 0 ) ^ ( 1 v 1 ) )
( ! ( 1 v 0 ) ^ ( 1 v 1 ) )
( ( 1 v 0 ) ^ ( 1 v 1 ) v ( 0 ^ 0 ) )
